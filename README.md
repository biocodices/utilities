## Convert a Jupyter Notebook to a nice HTML version
You need python 3.5 and `pip install grip`. I assume you already have `jupyter` installed if you're dealing with notebooks.

`convert_notebook_to_a_nice_HTML.py NOTEBOOK_PATH`

The script will create both a markdown (`.md`) and an HTML version of the notebook in the same directory and with the same filename (and different extension, obvs).
